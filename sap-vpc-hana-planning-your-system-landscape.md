# Planning your SAP system landscape
{: #planning-your-system-landscape}

An SAP landscape is a group of two or more SAP systems that usually include development, quality and test, and production. One SAP system consists of one or more *SAP instances*, which are a group of processes that are started and stopped at the same time. These *SAP instances* are grouped to form a specified SAP system for a defined use for a region or business unit. Then, the instances are grouped in a landscape as development, test, or production systems. Each system includes one or multiple tracks (such as "project" and "business"). This landscape design is up to each business, dependent on business requirements.
{: shortdesc}

Landscapes have several possible configurations, such as server size (CPU, RAM) and storage size, for all SAP solutions in the market. These solutions include SAP NetWeaver-based products that range from older solutions, such as SAP ECC and SAP BW that use "AnyDB" vendors that are approved by SAP, to the new range of SAP solutions, such as SAP S/4HANA and SAP BW/4HANA that use SAP HANA database. Beyond the enterprise resource planning (ERP) and enterprise data warehouse (EDW) examples, there are many available SAP products or add-ons for different industries and business types.

SAP HANA-based products are designed to run on SAP HANA-certified {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachinesshort}}. The certified {{site.data.keyword.vsi_is_short}} operating systems and supported database systems for {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} are listed in [SAP Note 2927211](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2927211){: external}.

SAP HANA can run as a database for an SAP NetWeaver stack-based solution or as a standalone entity depending on your usage scenario. For both scenarios, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offering provides preconfigured SAP NetWeaver-certified servers where the landscape around those servers can be built from any other server.

More solutions that are not SAP NetWeaver- nor SAP HANA-based are available from SAP. Those solutions and many third-party software options that might integrate with SAP can affect the planning of your system landscape. Contact [SAP Support](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html){: external} if you plan to deploy and integrate non-SAP HANA-based or third-party software into your SAP landscape on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
{: note}

You want to be as detailed as possible when you determine the size of your server based on the applications that you plan to run, potential growth, and performance. Additionally, keep in mind your storage and memory requirements for your applications. SAP systems in a landscape have specific requirements for connectivity, either among each other or to external systems. For more information, see [Items to consider when you plan your SAP landscape](/docs/sap-vpc-hana?topic=sap-vpc-hana-considerations).

## Determining your SAP HANA applications
{: #determining-your-sap-hana-applications}

Your business and functional requirements determine the SAP solutions to run on the SAP HANA stack. Your requirements have an influence on how you size your server. You have a wide selection of SAP HANA-based applications to choose from, including SAP BW/4HANA, SAP S/4HANA, and customer engagement and commerce solutions.

Items to consider when you make your determinations:
  * How do you intend to use the applications? Is the intended use for development and testing, or production?
  * How do you intend to connect your SAP workloads in Cloud to your existing network and systems?

## Next Steps
